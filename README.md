So I thought mines only going off for players only seemed dumb, so I made this mod to make anything that stands on it set them off.

So far mines will go off and kill anything. If it is immortal then you have to get another mod to set them to killable and then the mines will kill them.
Most vanilla traps have been added meaning for example turrets will target and damage enemies.
Lethal Things Boomba support has been added. 

Everyone that can die will die by stepping on land mines, sea mines, berthas, and boombas. Turrets will also target and shoot anyone without mercy. Quicksand will now kill enemies. Can set whether to check for players nearby before trap triggering.
